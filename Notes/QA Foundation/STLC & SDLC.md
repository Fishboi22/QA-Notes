### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

SDLC is the **overall process** of building software — it’s what developers, designers, testers, and product managers all work through together.

Here are the **common SDLC phases** (in order):

1. **Requirement Gathering**  
    → What should this software do?
    
2. **Design**  
    → How will it be built? (architecture, UI mockups, etc.)
    
3. **Development (Coding)**  
    → Devs start writing the code.
    
4. **Testing**  
    → QA team tests the product to find bugs.
    
5. **Deployment**  
    → Product goes live.
    
6. **Maintenance**  
    → Fix bugs, make updates, improve
### STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)

STLC is the **tester’s playbook**. It's all the steps testers follow to plan, design, run, and report on tests.

Here are the **STLC phases**:

1. **Requirement Analysis**  
    → What should we test? Are the requirements testable?
    
2. **Test Planning**  
    → Strategy, tools, effort estimate, who’s doing what.
    
3. **Test Case Design**  
    → Write step-by-step test cases and test data.
    
4. **Test Environment Setup**  
    → Make sure everything needed to run tests is ready.
    
5. **Test Execution**  
    → Run the tests and log bugs.
    
6. **Test Closure**  
    → Write final reports, lessons learned, etc


The Phases are concurrent, or parallel. They are designed to work together. This ensures a better product, and provides cost-savings or bugs later on.
